OPENSCAD BEST PRACTICES AND SYNTAX RULES
==========================================

1. BASIC SYNTAX RULES:
   - All statements must end with semicolon (;)
   - Use proper indentation for readability
   - Variables must be declared before use
   - Module names should be descriptive and use snake_case
   - Comments start with // for single line or /* */ for multi-line

2. GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVES:
   - cube([x, y, z]) - creates a rectangular box
   - cylinder(h=height, r=radius, d=diameter) - creates a cylinder
   - sphere(r=radius, d=diameter) - creates a sphere
   - cone(h=height, r1=bottom_radius, r2=top_radius) - creates a cone

3. TRANSFORMATIONS:
   - translate([x, y, z]) - moves object in 3D space
   - rotate([x_angle, y_angle, z_angle]) - rotates around axes
   - scale([x_factor, y_factor, z_factor]) - scales object
   - mirror([x, y, z]) - mirrors object across plane

4. BOOLEAN OPERATIONS:
   - union() - combines multiple objects
   - difference() - subtracts second object from first
   - intersection() - keeps only overlapping parts
   - hull() - creates convex hull of child objects

5. 2D TO 3D CONVERSION:
   - linear_extrude(height, center, convexity, twist, slices) - extrudes 2D shape
   - rotate_extrude(angle, convexity) - rotates 2D shape around Z-axis
   - IMPORTANT: 2D shapes (circle, square, polygon) must be extruded to become 3D

6. COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
   - Using 2D primitives in 3D context without extrusion
   - Missing semicolons at end of statements
   - Incorrect parameter names (use h for height, r for radius, d for diameter)
   - Using hull() with 2D objects
   - Unmatched parentheses or braces

7. PARAMETRIC DESIGN:
   - Use variables for dimensions: length = 100;
   - Make models easily modifiable
   - Use mathematical expressions: width = length * 0.5;
   - Group related parameters together

8. MODULE STRUCTURE:
   - Start with parameter definitions
   - Use descriptive module names
   - Include comments explaining complex operations
   - End with the main object or union of objects

9. VALIDATION RULES:
   - All dimensions must be positive numbers
   - Radius and diameter cannot be zero
   - Height values must be positive
   - $fn parameter controls resolution (higher = smoother circles)

10. FURNITURE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:
    - Use realistic dimensions (mm or cm, not meters)
    - Typical chair dimensions: 400-500mm width, 400-500mm depth, 800-900mm height
    - Leg diameters: 20-50mm for stability
    - Seat height: 400-500mm from ground
    - Backrest angle: 5-15 degrees from vertical

11. ERROR PREVENTION:
    - Always test boolean operations for validity
    - Check that transformations don't create degenerate geometry
    - Verify that all faces in polyhedron are properly oriented
    - Use $fn=32 or higher for smooth circular objects

12. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Code must compile without errors in OpenSCAD
    - No markdown formatting in output
    - Pure OpenSCAD syntax only
    - Include clear comments for major operations
    - Use parametric variables for easy modification
